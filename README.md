# Coral examples using TensorFlow Lite API

This repo contains example code for running inference on [Coral
devices](https://coral.withgoogle.com/products) using the [TensorFlow Lite
API](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite). Each example executes a different type of
model, such as an image classification or object detection model.

For instructions to set up and run the code, see the README inside each example.

Note: use ``pip3 install --extra-index-url https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/ tflite_runtime`` in your command terminal to install the tflite runtime for Win10.
